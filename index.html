					<h2>Welcome</h2>

					<p>Hi. My name is <strong>Albert Brown</strong> and I would like to personally welcome you to my website. I really enjoy every aspect of this business and have always had a burning passion when filming and taking pictures of people at events. My creativeness, willingness to learn and excel further with each and every project, allows me to help others savor their memories. </p>

					<h2>Video Portfolio</h2>
					<p>Please enjoy some of my work below by clicking on the videos to watch them. Some have music edited into the videos and some don't. Filming and editing has been a passion of mine since I can remember. Filming and creating memories is what I enjoy most. I'm currently majoring in Digital Filmmaking and Video Production at the Art Institute. I currently also volunteer with my church in the media department every Wednesday and Sunday for church services. At those services I work with many types of cameras operating them for a large live production.</p>
					<p>I've always had a passion for videography and photography. I would love to speak with you about helping with any events you have in mind. During these tough economic times, I'm more than happy to discuss/negotiate prices to anyone interested in my service. I promise you will get great work without spending a fortune for it. We will discuss what your looking for and fit it within a budget you're satisfied with. I look forward to working with you. Thank you!</p>

							<h2>‪2010 Graduation at UNLV</h2>

							<p>Graduation's are an important time of any persons life.  Having it captured and turned into a work of art takes passion. I have to admit, during the editing of this, it was hard to hold back my emotions. Everyone that has watched it, has told me the same thing. Take a look at it and let me know what you think.</p>

							<h2>‪Reebok Commercial</h2>
							<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uHFUsaE9yh4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>My good friend Jontae is CEO/Commissioner of the website Who's Your Five. This a a great networking site that brings businesses and people together and network. It's free to join, and you earn points just for networking that can go towards nice rewards. Reebok recently donated the ZigTech's for him to try out. To thank them, we made a short commercial. Enjoy.</p>

							<h2>‪Broken (First short film)</h2>
							<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CQvlTDklheE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>This was the first short film that I was part of at my school that I attend. Directed & Written by Jake Hussey, this film is about a young woman that suffers from a horrible loss in her life and has trouble dealing with it. Let me know what you think about the film and if their is anything you would change. Thanks!</p>

							<p>We had to complete an easy how to video for my class. Shaving seems like a pretty easy process to me since I have to do it everyday. But rather than having a boring how to video, I had a little fun with it. This is the version without the music. Try not to laugh too much at the end. Enjoy!</p>

						<div id="morph_school">
							<h2>‪Morph School (Second short film)</h2>
							<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1m49RDYt56E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>In my second short film, I edited, wrote and directed a movie about weird things going on in a school. My instructor said, "Think weird and see what you can come up with", so that's what I did. This version doesn't have the music in it. If interested, I can show you the version with the music. Check it out! </p>

							<h2>‪Motion</h2>
							<iframe width="853" height="640" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8gO02IRa6ck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>This film is about things in motion. Nothing more, nothing less. This is one of my earlier projects, my editing could of been a little tighter during the car scene. Take a look at it and tell me if you agree.</p>

						<div id="champ">
							<h2>‪The Champ</h2>
							<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7g4ZuX5Jqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>I played Bob the security guard in this short project for my school. I know my producing, editing, & directing might be a little better than my acting right now. Practice makes perfect though!</p>
